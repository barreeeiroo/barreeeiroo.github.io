Kodular is an online platform which enables everyone to create any kind of mobile app without the need to know how to
code. Just by dragging and dropping a few components and blocks, anything can be created.

In Summer 2017, this project started as some kind of part-time project made by high-school students. It kept growing
and became a full company in 2019. More than 2M apps have been created since then.
