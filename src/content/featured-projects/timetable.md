An intelligent scheduling system developed as my final thesis project that tackles the notoriously complex Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling problem. The platform combines a powerful constraint-solving engine using Answer-Set Programming (ASP) with Clingo, wrapped in a user-friendly React interface.

Architected as a fully serverless solution on AWS using Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3, the system handles intricate university scheduling constraints from room capacities and teacher availability to course prerequisites and student preferences. The solving algorithm is open-source, contributing to academic research in automated scheduling.
