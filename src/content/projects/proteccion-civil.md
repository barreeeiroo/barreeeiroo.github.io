A comprehensive digital transformation solution for civil defense operations in Santiago de Compostela.
This dual-platform system includes an internal resource management tool and a public-facing website, completely
replacing decades-old paper-based workflows with an intuitive web-based system.

Built with Java and React, the platform features real-time resource tracking, volunteer coordination, and emergency
response workflow automation. What began as a volunteer project during my International Baccalaureate has grown into
critical infrastructure serving the local community.
